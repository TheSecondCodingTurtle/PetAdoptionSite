# PetAdoptionSite

A local pet adoption centre needs a computer system to help match potential pet owners with suitable animals
and manage their adoption process. The system needs to:
- Store information about available pets
- Record details about potential adopters
- Match pets with suitable owners based on compatibility criteria
- Track adoption history
- Calculate adoption fees with discounts
